Instructions:
-------------

You are given a list of numbers. 

Your task is to create a new list that only includes the numbers that are not prime. 

A prime number is any number greater than 1 that has only 2 factors it can divide by: 1 and itself.

For example, your list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]. 

In this list, the numbers 1, 4, and 6 are not prime. 

So, your new list should show only this: [1, 4, 6].
