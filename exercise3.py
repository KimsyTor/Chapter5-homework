Instructions:
-------------

You are given a list of numbers. 

Your task is to calculate the product of all the numbers in the list.

Use the calculate_product function and pass the list as an argument to the function.

Here's an example:

multiply_list = [8, 3, 1, -1, -1]
calculate_product(multiply_list)

In this example, the output will be 24 because: 

8 * 3 = 24
24 * 1 = 24
24 * -1 = -24
-24 * -1 = 24
