'''
Instructions:
-------------

Your task is to create a function that identifies the pattern in two different lists. 

You will be given a list of numbers. 

This list follows a certain pattern (Hint: review README).

Your function should identify the pattern in the list and return the result.

Example: 

my_list: [2, 4, 6] -> Output: 2

In this example, the output is 2 because the pattern is a factor of 2.

numbers = [3, 6, 9, 12]

def detect_pattern(numbers):
    # Your code goes here
    pass

def main():
    # Your UI code goes here (add user input and show how to use the function with the example list)
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
